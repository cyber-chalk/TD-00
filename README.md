# Todo-app 📅

## description ✏️
This website intends to set reminders through accurate clocks and timers.
this is done through the use of javascript and possibly typescript (I do not know typescript,
but if anyone wishes to make a pull request and implement ts they are welcome to do so)
any other languages wont be accepted through a pr (including web assembly)

## How to test/run 🎬
to run the code (currently) you will need to clone the files and open the html file in a browser tab.
Or you can just click this button to view the code in the browser
